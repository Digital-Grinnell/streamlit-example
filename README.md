## Welcome to Streamlit!

Edit `/streamlit_app.py` to customize this app to your heart's desire. :heart:  Better yet, clone a copy of this project to keep this one pristine, and work on the `/streamlit_app.py` file in that new project!  

If you have any questions, checkout our [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io) and [community forums](https://discuss.streamlit.io).

### Initial Changes

For starters, I renamed `requirements.txt` to `python-requirements.txt` since the former name can sometimes caused issues with automated cloud deployments.  

After that I followed the guideance provided in [Proper Python](https://blog.summittdweller.com/proper-python/) to complete my initial setup here.  

### Running Locally

Based on the guidance at [Run your Streamlit app](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/run-your-app) you can locally run your Streamlit app using: 

```zsh
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
